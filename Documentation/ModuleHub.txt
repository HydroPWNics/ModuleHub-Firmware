Module "AS1"       (component Serial_LDD)
   - AS1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. Method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled. This method finishes immediately after calling it - it 
                doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> to check the end of data transmission or 
                method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - AS1_ReceiveBlock -Specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified number of 
                characters is received. Method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive operation. If a 
                receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has already finished) 
                all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data call the method 
                immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> event). This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use event <OnBlockReceived> 
                to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of receiving.

Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.

Module "DMACH1"    (component DMAChannel_LDD)
   - DMACH1_Init -Initializes the DMAChannel_LDD component. This method allocates no memory. Memory for all DMA used channles 
                is allocated by DMAController componet .  This method can be called only once. Before the second call of Init() 
                the Deinit() must be called first.
   - DMACH1_StartTransfer -The method starts DMA transfer on the selected DMA channel. This methods initiates explicit SW 
                transfer request. Please note that call of this method if peripheral request is enabled can cause unpredictable 
                behaviour.
   - DMACH1_GetError -Returns channel error flags and clears these flags.
   - DMACH1_SetRequestCount -Sets number of requests required to complete transfer.

Module "DMA1"      (component DMAController)

Module "AS2"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS2_Enable -Enables the component - it starts the send and receive functions. Events may be generated 
                ("DisableEvent"/"EnableEvent").
   - AS2_Disable -Disables the component - it stops the send and receive functions. No events will be generated.
   - AS2_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS2_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS2_RecvBlock -If any data is received, this method returns the block of the data and its length (and incidental error), 
                otherwise it returns an error code (it does not wait for data).  This method is available only if non-zero 
                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - AS2_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS2_ClearRxBuf -Clears the receive buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the input buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS2_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS2_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS2_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits7_SetBit -Sets (to one) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, TRUE)]. 
                (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bits7_ClrBit -Clears (sets to zero) the specified bit of the Input/Output component. It is the same as [PutBit(Bit, FALSE)
                ]. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
